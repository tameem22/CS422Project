Pursuit App - Adventure Marketplace

How to start:
    
    1. Enter information for a destination within the search bar and search for that destination. If no activities show up in the next page (likely as there aren't that many activities in this iteration) erase the destination on the filter menu on the left. The user can then select any filters to find an activity they want.
    2. Select a location or activity type on the bottom of the screen. 


Deviations from pixel perfect prototype:
    
    "Planning" page was split into a MyPlans and Checkout page as this provides a better experience for users to plan their trips. One of the selling points for pursuit is to be organized and confident in your trip before booking, the MyPlans page provides this. It also provides a utility to invite friends to a trip and keep track of members who are going to help push users out of their comfort zone and experience new things with their friends.
